    "## Why the Power Sector?\n",
    "\n",
    "India's power sector is one of the largest contributors to national greenhouse gas emissions, primarily due to its historical reliance on coal-based thermal power generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As India pursues its climate commitments and long-term net-zero goals, decarbonising the power sector becomes a foundational requirement. A cleaner power mix enables downstream decarbonisation across industries, transport, and households.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this transition is capital-intensive and time-bound. Significant investments are required not only in renewable generation, but also in grid modernisation, energy storage, and the gradual phase-down or repurposing of existing thermal assets.\n"

    "## Why Transition Finance Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition of the power sector is not only a technological challenge, but also a financial one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large-scale deployment of renewable energy, grid upgrades, and asset transitions require substantial long-term capital. Financial institutions play a critical role in enabling this transition through instruments such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sustainability-linked loans  \n",
    "- Green loans  \n",
    "- Green and transition bonds  \n",
    "- Blended finance structures  \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the scale and structure of these financing needs is essential for directing capital efficiently and accelerating the energy transition.\n"

    "- Establish a baseline of India's current power generation capacity\n",
    "- Identify transition pathways towards a cleaner power mix\n",
    "- Estimate the capital expenditure required for this transition\n",

    "- Generate insights relevant for climate finance, banking, and energy strategy roles\n",

    "The analysis focuses on order-of-magnitude estimates rather than precise forecasts, prioritising transparency and interpretability.\n"
