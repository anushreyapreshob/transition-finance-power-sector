    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The power sector transition requires significant capital deployment over the coming decades. While the scale of investment is large, the primary constraint is not capital availability but the bankability of projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis demonstrates that:\n",
    "- The transition is predominantly debt-financed, placing banks and capital markets at the centre of execution.\n",
    "- Financing structures are well understood, but risks—particularly policy and counterparty risks—continue to influence capital allocation.\n",
    "- De-risking mechanisms such as long-term PPAs, payment security structures, and DFI participation are critical to unlocking commercial capital at scale.\n"

    "## What the Model Demonstrates\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scale Matters**  \n",
    "   Even conservative assumptions translate into large capital requirements, underscoring the importance of institutional finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Banks Are Central**  \n",
    "   Commercial banks remain the primary providers of transition debt, complemented by green bonds and development finance institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Risk Is the Binding Constraint**  \n",
    "   Without effective de-risking, capital costs rise and project pipelines stall.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Blended Finance Plays a Catalytic Role**  \n",
    "   DFIs and guarantees disproportionately increase private capital mobilisation relative to their capital contribution.\n"

    "## Implications for Financial Institutions\n",
    "\n",
    "For banks and financial institutions, the power transition represents:\n",
    "- A large, long-tenor lending opportunity\n",
    "- Demand for structured finance, guarantees, and advisory services\n",
    "- Increased importance of sustainability-linked and green financing instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "However, success depends on the ability to assess and mitigate non-traditional risks, particularly those related to policy and counterparties.\n"

    "- Incorporating higher-resolution cost and capacity data\n",
    "- Adding time phasing to estimate annual financing flows\n",
    "- Stress-testing financing needs under different transition scenarios\n",
    "- Linking risk profiles to pricing outcomes such as cost of debt\n"

    "Mobilising capital for the power transition is less a question of capital availability and more a question of structuring, risk allocation, and institutional coordination.\n"
