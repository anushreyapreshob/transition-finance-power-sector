# transition-finance-power-sector
A data-driven project estimating transition finance requirements for decarbonising India's power sector.

---

## Methodology Overview

### 1. Context & Assumptions
- Power transition framed as a **financing challenge**
- Capacity and cost assumptions kept illustrative and transparent

### 2. Transition Capex Estimation
- Aggregate capital required under a simplified transition pathway
- Focus on order-of-magnitude realism rather than false precision

### 3. Financing Structure
- Debt–equity split consistent with project finance norms
- Debt decomposed into:
  - Commercial bank lending
  - Green bonds
  - Development finance institutions (DFIs)
- Visualisation of capital stacks and financing mix

### 4. Risk & De-Risking Framework
- Identification of key risks:
  - Policy & regulatory
  - Counterparty
  - Technology
  - Construction
  - Market
- Mapping of risks to common de-risking mechanisms
- Qualitative heatmap showing risk reduction post de-risking

### 5. Executive Synthesis
- Key insights for financial institutions
- Strategic implications for transition finance
- Clear articulation of limitations and extension pathways

## Key Insights

- The power transition is **predominantly debt-financed**, placing banks and capital markets at the centre of execution  
- Capital availability is not the main bottleneck — **risk and bankability are**
- De-risking mechanisms such as long-term PPAs, payment security structures, and DFI participation are critical to unlocking private capital
- Blended finance plays a catalytic role disproportionate to its capital contribution

---

## Limitations & Assumptions

- All figures are **illustrative and directional**
- Risk scoring is qualitative to avoid false precision
- Model does not yet include:
  - Time phasing of investments
  - Cost of capital or pricing outcomes
  - Technology-specific granularity

These are intentional trade-offs for clarity and transparency.

---

## Potential Extensions

- Scenario analysis (fast vs slow transition)
- Time-phased financing flows
- Linking risk profiles to cost of debt
- Technology-level capex breakdown
- Country or region-specific deep dives

## Author’s Note

This project was developed as a self-driven learning and portfolio exercise to better understand how climate transition goals translate into financing structures and risk allocation within the power sector.
